				The Humanitarian Parole (CHNV) Will End for 530,000 Individuals
			</h1>
			<h2> The Biden administration has decided to not extend the parole program introduced in 2023 for Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, Haitans and Cubans aiming to discourage crossing through the U.S.-Mexico border. The first individuals to lose their legal status will do so in January of 2025 and will face the difficult options: applying for different legal status or face uncertain futures as Trump’s promise of “Mass Deportations” looms on the horizon. </h2>

				<p class="intro"> <span class="location"> Manhattan, New York City — </span> Cold rain falls in New York City as Judith Alvarez, a 26-year-old from Nicaragua, steps into the subway for shelter. She usually walks the twenty or so blocks from her sponsor family’s home to evening English classes at the public library. Alvarez is one of more than 96,000 Nicaraguans who’ve been approved for a two-year legal status in the United States under the Department of Homeland Security’s Humanitarian Parole program.  
				</p>
				 <p>
				“A lot of my friends had the opportunity to travel here like this but, I do have friends that arrived over land and it was very risky. They almost lost their lives. Thanks to this program, I’m here legally and it feels like a great opportunity,” said Alvarez while reflecting on her eight months into the program (translated from Spanish). “Coming to the United States is a refuge”. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently, the <a href=https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/reports/fy2023_annual_statistical_report.pdf> Humanitarian Parole legal status is granted across three main programs</a> created to address countries facing extreme events or situations. The “Uniting for Ukraine” was launched in April of 2022 following the unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine. In the wake of the United States pulling out of Afghanistan in 2021, “Operation Allies Welcome” was initiated and currently covers over 133,000 Afghans. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In January of 2023, the Biden administration expanded the Humanitarian Parole program designed for Venezuelans to also include Cuba, Nicaragua and Haiti with the hopes of lessening irregular crossings at the U.S- Mexico border. It then became referred to as the CHNV program.

				<p>
				The Department of Homeland Security reports, <a href=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/07/25/fact-sheet-data-first-six-months-parole-processes-cubans-haitians-nicaraguans-and>as of August 2024, 530,000 individual’s applying to the CHNV program had been approved and arrived under the legal status.</a> 
				</p>
				<p>
				In October of this year, the Biden administration announced it would not extend the program effectively leaving all of its participants with uncertain futures. Their choices are limited: apply to already strained forms of legal status like asylum, or face the possibility of removal under the <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/us/politics/trump-immigration-deportations.html?searchResultPosition=3 >incoming administration's claims of mass deportations.</a>  
				</p>
				<p>
				Individual’s from Venezuela and Haiti may turn to existing programs such as Temporary Protected Status (TPS), while Cubans have the potential to qualify for the Cuban Adjustment Act. Nicaraguans under the program may only have political asylum to rely on, an already strained avenue for reaching legal status. 
				</p>
				<p>
				<a href=https://trac.syr.edu/reports/751/ > Asylum grant rates have declined by a third compared to last year </a>, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) Clearinghouse, a nonpartisan research center at Syracuse University. Beneficiaries of the CHNV program will have to contend with some of the lowest asylum grant rates since 2020, and a <a href=https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/asylumbl/ > backlog in immigration cases surpassing 1 million.</a> 
				</p>
				<p>
				With the program ending for her in a little more than a year, Alvarez has decided to apply for political asylum due to her involvement in social work organizations and her Christain faith, as she claims both are reasons she would be persecuted by the Nicaraguan government. Yet, even with her proactive decision, Alvarez faces challenges shared by many in her similar situation.

				</script>
				<p>
				Although Alvarez found a cashier’s job with the help of a job placement agency (for a $150 fee), legal representation remains unattainable for her as she prepares her application for the arduous process, which can take years. 
				</p>
				<p>
				“I don’t want to be illegal. I want a legal status and to not affect anyone else,” Alvarez said. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The family which sponsors Alvarez supports her by providing accommodations and guidance in navigating the complicated system faced by newly arrived migrants. She will rely on them and non-profit organizations to ensure she submits the strongest application, avoiding the $5,000-20,000 fees quoted by immigration attorneys. 
				</p>
				<p>
				At the end of 2023, <a href= https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/asyfile/ > the number of pending asylum applications topped 1.6 million</a>, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) Clearinghouse, a nonpartisan research center at Syracuse University.
				</p>
				<p>
				Resistance to the termination of the programs and advocacy for migrants in limbo has sprouted as quickly as the announcements from both the Biden administration and President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team. For example, <a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2024/11/18/trump-mass-deportation-aclu-lawsuit/ >the ACLU has filed federal lawsuits against the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.</a> 
				</p>
              <p>
             “I want to support my family. I hope to support myself the way I couldn’t in my own country,” Alvarez said of her thoughts about the future.
